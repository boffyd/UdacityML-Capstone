The datasource consists of two locations.

### Location 1 - Bureau of Meterology

This was accessed individually and CSV files downloaded for each year for each of the parameters ,maximum temperature and rainfall.

### Location 2 - Victorian Alpine Resorts - Daily Snow Depth Records Falls Creek

> 'https://arcc.vic.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Data-2020-Daily-Snow-Depth-Records_Falls-Creek.csv'
